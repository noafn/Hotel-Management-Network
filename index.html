                                    <p>This project, titled CloudConnect, focuses on designing and implementing a secure, efficient, and scalable network infrastructure for a modern hotel building comprising three floors and eight key departments. The aim is to optimize internal operations, ensure seamless communication among departments, and deliver uninterrupted service to both staff and guests.

Implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer, the project incorporates industry-standard technologies such as VLAN segmentation to logically isolate departments, dynamic routing with OSPF for efficient inter-floor communication, DHCP for automated IP management, and SSH for secure remote access. Additional features include dedicated Wi-Fi networks per floor and strict port security policies to prevent unauthorized device access. The entire architecture follows a layered (core-distribution-access) model to ensure modularity, maintainability, and future scalability. This design not only demonstrates a practical application of networking principles but also prepares the infrastructure for real-world hotel management needs. CloudConnect empowers you with full control, minimal manual effort, and an improved experience for both customers and administrators.

                                                <p>Our hotel network is designed with a hierarchical topology that separates responsibilities between access, distribution, and core layers. Each floor is equipped with a switch connected to routers placed centrally in the server room. The use of VLANs ensures logical separation of departments, while centralized routing using OSPF allows efficient inter-VLAN communication. The minimal design avoids redundancy and focuses on clarity, ensuring a well-organized and easy-to-maintain structure.

                                                <p>The CloudConnect system supports all essential networking needs of a modern hotel by logically segmenting departments and managing connections floor-wise. On the first floor, the Reception, Store, and Logistics departments operate on VLANs 80, 70, and 60 respectively, each with its own dedicated IP subnet. Similarly, the second floor houses the Finance, HR, and Sales departments on VLANs 50, 40, and 30. The third floor includes the Admin and IT departments, which are assigned VLANs 20 and 10. To streamline network management and avoid manual IP assignment, all devices across the hotel obtain their IP addresses dynamically from DHCP servers configured within their respective routers.

In addition to wired connectivity, each floor is equipped with a wireless access point broadcasting an SSID associated with the correct VLAN. This ensures that wireless devices like laptops and smartphones have secure and VLAN-consistent network access. Secure Shell (SSH) is implemented on all routers to allow authorized personnel to perform remote administration. Furthermore, port security measures are applied, especially in the IT department, to prevent unauthorized access—such as restricting port fa0/1 to a designated test PC. These usage implementations reflect a real-world, practical approach to managing security, scalability, and efficient data flow in a hotel environment.
													CloudConnect adapts to your operational needs while keeping it simple and secure. </p>

                                    <p class="m-top-20">At CloudConnect, creativity goes beyond aesthetics—it defines our entire approach to network design. Faced with the challenge of building a scalable, secure, and efficient hotel network, we explored creative solutions that aligned with real-world demands. Instead of relying solely on standard configurations, we reimagined how hotel departments could be logically isolated yet still seamlessly connected through dynamic routing and VLAN segmentation. We creatively utilized OSPF for flexible path selection, integrated DHCP for automated IP assignment, and linked wireless access points to VLANs for mobile-friendly connectivity.

Our design also incorporates port security and SSH-based management—not as add-ons, but as integral parts of a unified system. What makes it creative is not just the tools used, but how they work together harmoniously. Whether it’s the layered topology or the smart placement of routers and switches, each decision reflects thoughtful planning. The result is a network that is not only technically robust but also intuitive, scalable, and tailored for the fast-paced hospitality environment. At CloudConnect, we’ve proven that technical solutions can be as imaginative as they are effective.

                                    <p class="m-top-20">At CloudConnect, we embrace the philosophy that less is more—especially when it comes to network design. Our architecture emphasizes simplicity in both layout and configuration. Every VLAN, IP addressing scheme, routing protocol, and physical connection has been carefully selected to fulfill a clear purpose without introducing unnecessary complexity. By minimizing overlapping configurations and redundant paths, we’ve ensured that the network remains easy to manage, scalable for future growth, and fast to troubleshoot when needed. This minimalism extends not only to the structural layout but also to the administrative approach, empowering network engineers to focus on functionality and clarity. Ultimately, CloudConnect demonstrates that effective design is not about cramming features—it’s about executing the essentials beautifully and intelligently. Minimalism is not about doing less—it's about doing what's necessary, beautifully.

                                <p>The CloudConnect hotel network architecture exemplifies a well-structured blend of physical layout and logical configuration. Central to this design are the routers, which are located in the server room on the third floor within the IT department. These routers are interconnected using serial DCE cables and are linked to switches on each of the three floors, forming a hierarchical topology that ensures both modularity and expandability. VLANs are meticulously planned across the departments—ranging from VLAN 10 to VLAN 80—each mapped to a unique department with its own IP subnet for logical separation and controlled communication.

Routing between VLANs and floors is handled through the dynamic OSPF protocol, which enables routers to discover and share optimal paths automatically. To facilitate automatic IP assignment, each router is configured as a DHCP server that allocates IP addresses to client devices based on their VLAN configuration. For administrative security, SSH access is configured on all routers, allowing encrypted remote management by IT personnel. Additionally, port security settings are enforced, particularly on the IT floor switch, where port fa0/1 is restricted to only accept connections from a pre-registered Test-PC. Wireless access points on each floor are configured to extend network access to mobile users, with each SSID linked to its corresponding VLAN to preserve segmentation. Altogether, the network infrastructure is robust, secure, and fine-tuned for hotel-specific operations.</p>

                                    <p>CloudConnect is a simulated hotel networking system designed to replicate a modern, secure, and efficient network infrastructure for hospitality environments. Built using Cisco Packet Tracer, it demonstrates how a hotel can implement centralized access control, billing integration, and VLAN-based segmentation to manage staff, guest, and admin networks separately. The project includes wireless and wired connectivity across multiple zones, along with server deployment for DHCP, DNS, and web-based access. CloudConnect offers a practical approach to learning enterprise-level networking, aligning academic objectives with real-world implementation in the hospitality sector. </p>
